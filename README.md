# 🤖 AI Echo: Your Smartest Conversational Partner

AI Echo is an intelligent conversational AI project designed to analyze user input, understand sentiment, and provide meaningful responses.  
It combines **NLP techniques**, **machine learning** to enhance customer experience and business analytics.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a given text.  
This project aims to build an **AI-powered conversational system** that can:
- Understand user inputs.
- Classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- Provide smart conversational feedback.
- Enable deployment-ready architecture for real-world usage.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Customer experience plays a critical role in business success. Traditional feedback systems often fail to capture real-time sentiment effectively.  
AI Echo solves this by using **machine learning models** and **sentiment analysis** to provide actionable insights from conversations.

## 📊 Model Workflow
1. Load and preprocess dataset.  
2. Perform EDA with visualizations (word frequency, word clouds, sentiment distribution).  
3. Train ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
4. (Optional) Train Deep Learning models (LSTM, BERT).  
5. Evaluate models using classification report & confusion matrix.  
6. Deploy best model with Streamlit or Flask.
